# WAN Traffic Engineering Project

### Information

* Group number: *[[ your group number ]]*
* Student NetIDs: *[[ your netid1 ]]*, *[[ your netid2 ]]*

### Part C explanation

*[[ Replace this text with an explanation of the algorithm you use to select the paths in part C. ]]*

### Getting started

**Dependencies**

* Python 3.5+
* `pip3 install networkx`
* `pip3 install numpy`
* `pip3 install ortools`
* `pip3 install git+https://gitlab.ethz.ch/kassings/python-ortools-lp-parser.git` (you must authenticate)

**What you have to do in a nutshell**

1. You can verify your solutions yourself locally by running `cd code; python3 evaluator_myself.py`
2. Set your team name by editing team_name.txt
3. Implement code/skeleton_a.py (run via `cd code; python3 skeleton_a.py`)
4. Implement code/skeleton_b.py (run via `cd code; python3 skeleton_b.py`)
5. Implement code/skeleton_c.py (run via `cd code; python3 skeleton_c.py`)

Proper software engineering practices (e.g. splitting off shared functionality between the three parts into separate files) are encouraged. For any other explanation look at wan_te_project.pdf

**Leaderboard**

The output you commit and push into the Git repository in myself/output/c is evaluated every 5 min approximately. You can view the leaderboard at:
