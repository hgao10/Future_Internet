Our algorithm works as described in the paper: A Buffer-Based Approach to Rate Adaptation: Evidence from a Large Video Streaming Ser-
vice. We actually implemented the second algorithm presented in it, namely BBA1, which is optimized for variable bit rate (VBR) streaming. By optimizing the parameters for the reservoir and the cushion size we optimized our solution towards a higher score.
